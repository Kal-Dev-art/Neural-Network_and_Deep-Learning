# Neural-Network_and_Deep-Learning
The purpose of this analysis was to create, train, and evaluate a deep learning model using a neural network
to predict whether an organization will be successful in securing funding from Alphabet Soup. By using
historical data and applying classification techniques, we aim to help the non-profit organization make
informed decisions about funding opportunities.
